    Auditory or just barely visible (10-15% transparent) gui menu designed for cheating
    For USB: w (if using school comps) works both on java and cpp with the "course" information file.
        (would be great for bluetooth)
            With audio, more options open up.
            could try app for iphone but doubtful.
            We COULD record every single class session and have full videos.
                For each video we could save:
                    the name,
                    time and date,
                    class,
                    add quick timestamps for later search and navigation,
                    snip pieces out,
                        allow transferring snippet/clip into another save editor to save separately elsewhere
                    and topic/answer/advice,
                    stored via snippets of things (DO THIS ANYWAY CAUSE IT SOUNDS COOL)
                Perhaps add folder functionality for each class so subject matter and topics can be organized
                Search & Filter & Sort via name, date, class
                Save video (if consented) and mp3 (always)
                Auto-detect the date compared with the schedule and time and determine whether to record microphone and camera or to not
                    - Because of this, you must add a schedule either manually or by linking heartland's ole crappy webpage
                        - This could open the door to prompting "Did you get here on time? Yes | No | Yes, at __/__ __ | No, I was late 'x' [second(s), minute(s) hour(s)]
