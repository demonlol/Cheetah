Bunch of useful website implementations (if complicated) or inspired ones (that are easy to implement natively)
	Examples: https://www.wordmom.com/adjectives/that-start-with-p
			  https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/adjectives/adjectives-that-start-with-p.html
			  https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/adjectives/adjectives-that-start-with-i.html
			  https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/grammar/word-lists/nouns-that-start-with-p.html


	Add a bunch of random implementations from websites
	Like there are so many

P.I.M.P (Personal Intelligent Music Precache) Player
	- Plays
	- Syncs with server when we get one lmao

Pourn Proxy - Ultimate pourn proxy player so everything goes to plan.
	- No Ads   - Output Device   - Volume is configurable (always start at 0)   - Fullscreen   - Favorited video cache
	- Works like P.I.M.P except uses the hub for videos



Days Until/End Of…
- E.O.S (end of semester)
- E.O.W (end of week)
- E.O.M (end of month)
- E.O.Y (end of year)
- E.O.C (end of college? Idk when)
- E.O.D (end of day; midnight?)

Scenario:
	I know none of the questions on the test or quiz
	I communicate with my client somehow so it sends all of what im typing either in the moment like traditional keylog
	Or instead of sending foreach indivudla char, we can signal when we are done or still typing.
	Seems like an overlay would have to be present

Potential problem: When a certain time has passed while the program was offline: give it a query variable which tells us the last time it was queried? Or do we check at what times the program was offline and figure it that way? Idk, this shouldn't be too hard to do once its in code

Math Helper:
	CollegeCalcuator    CollegeCreditsCaluations    Solve Same Problem Different easily
	MathWay either using ocr, copy/paste, or a selection screenshot
	MathWay has a combobox for what's expected to be done to the equation
	This can easily be coded for problems asking you to “evaulate” or “simplify”
		But not for graphing and such…
		The more I think about this, the more I think an extension or GM/TM script
		will suffice much better and have way more control over answer input.
		We want the work too…
Any way we can add the website in java? Selenium java library lol?

GUI console log for gui

Any way we can add the script via java (like when we go in to take a quiz/test and can quickly install the extension)
YouTube But Its Like Spotify (like musi w/ equalizer) (no ads)
Any way we can port forward our router to proxy my requests (built in and free vpn)
Any way we can play YouTube videos in java?
Any way we can get recommended YouTube videos in java?
Any way we can download/cache them for later?
Anyway we can search for youtube videos or scroll

🌟 Paper Editor (basically google docs w some tweaks)
	Word Processor:
		a background thread may check spelling and grammar
		a foreground thread processes user input (keystrokes)
		a third thread loads images from the hard drive
		a fourth does periodic automatic backups of the file being edited

🌟 Classes -> Grades -> Assignment Graph + Timeline

🌟 Schedule (+ Assignments + Reminders + Notes? + Classes) -> Timeline
	Show day 1am-12:59pm (initial drawing that I liked)
		Show what time it is with line in real time [scroll in to zoom, out to unzoom]
		Show classes / work
		Show assignments?
	Show week Sun-Sat?

	You can use AudioInputStream and its AudioFileFormat member (which contains an AudioFormat instance) to know what to
	write (format, sample rate), you can use AudioSystem to write it.
    Based on the sample rate of the format you can find out how many bytes of audio are 2 seconds, and go on a loop of
    reading that many bytes from the AudioInputStream, writing them to a new file.
